# ML for Bubble Growth

This project focuses on developing a predictive model for bubble growth in flowing liquid using machine learning techniques. The model is trained to predict bubble growth based on various parameters like pressure, mass flux, density, and subcooling. By applying advanced machine learning algorithms, we achieved a high degree of accuracy, making the model useful for scientific and industrial applications.

## Key Features

- **Comprehensive Dataset**: A detailed dataset was created with crucial parameters such as pressure, mass flux, density, and subcooling, ensuring robust model training.
  
- **XGBoost Regression Model**: The core model uses the XGBoost algorithm, resulting in an RÂ² score of up to 83%, demonstrating the model's predictive power.
  
- **Data Preprocessing and Feature Engineering**: Advanced techniques for data preprocessing and feature engineering were applied, boosting the predictive accuracy by 20%.

## Project Structure

The project is organized into the following folders:

- **assets/**: Contains all the references and papers used during research and model development.
  
- **data/**: Stores all the data collected for training and testing the model.
  
- **model/**: Includes the code for data collection, model training, and evaluation.
